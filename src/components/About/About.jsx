          <p>
            The date we started running is Jan 8, 2024. The end of the road is
            the summit. We are fully motivated and moving forward step by step.
            We will be successful in this business. Together with the Clarusway
            team, our Mentor Ertuğrul, whom we put in a special place, has
            contributed a lot to us and continues to do so. 😎👏
